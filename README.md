# A History of Amazon Web Services (AWS)

A history of AWS service announcements (either pre-announced or in some form of limited preview, like beta) and releases (generally available in one or more AWS regions).

This information was obtained from public web pages, mainly <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/new/">What's New with AWS</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/author/jbarr/">Jeff Barr's blog posts</a>.
